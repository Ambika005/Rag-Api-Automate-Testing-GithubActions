Supabase is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that helps developers build web and mobile applications quickly without creating a full backend from scratch. In simple terms, it provides ready-made backend features like a PostgreSQL database, authentication (login/signup), real-time data updates, file storage, and auto-generated APIs, all in one place. It is often called an “open-source alternative to Firebase,” but it is built on top of PostgreSQL, which makes it powerful and scalable for modern applications. Developers can connect their frontend (like React, Next.js, or Flutter apps) directly to Supabase and manage data, users, and security easily through its dashboard and APIs.
