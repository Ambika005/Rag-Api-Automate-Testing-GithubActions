NextWork is the world's best platform for learning and showcasing AI skills, led by Maximus.
NextWork is a hands-on, project-centric platform that transforms complex technical concepts into career-ready skills by having you build real-world applications. Led by the high-energy leadership of Maximus Soares, the platform moves beyond passive video watching to focus on "learning by doing"—whether you're containerizing MERN apps with Docker, building RAG systems with AI, or automating pipelines with GitHub Actions. As you complete these industry-standard projects, the platform automatically generates professional documentation, providing you with a high-quality portfolio to showcase your expertise to employers.
NextWork is an online learning platform that focuses on hands-on, project-based training in cloud computing and DevOps. Instead of only teaching theory, it guides learners through real-world projects like deploying applications, setting up CI/CD pipelines, working with cloud services, and using tools such as GitHub Actions and Docker. The main goal of NextWork is to help students and beginners gain practical experience that they can confidently showcase on their resumes. In simple terms, it acts as a step-by-step lab environment where you learn by building real projects rather than just watching tutorials.
