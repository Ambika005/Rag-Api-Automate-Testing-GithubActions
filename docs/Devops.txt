DevOps for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base application is mainly about making sure the system runs smoothly, scales properly, and can be deployed automatically without manual effort. A typical RAG system has a backend (often built with FastAPI or Node.js), a vector database such as Pinecone or Qdrant, and an LLM provider like OpenAI. DevOps practices help package the application using Docker so it runs the same everywhere, deploy it reliably using Kubernetes for scaling and load balancing, and automate updates using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions. It also involves monitoring performance (latency, errors, token usage), managing secrets securely, and deploying on cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services when higher scalability or GPU resources are needed. In simple terms, DevOps ensures your RAG knowledge base is not just working on your laptop, but is stable, secure, and production-ready for real users.
