Kubernetes is a large scale container Orchestration  tool used to manage containers at scale.
In a Kubernetes ecosystem, Minikube acts as your local "sandbox" cluster for practice, while Kubectl is the "remote control" command-line tool you use to manage it. Your application code runs inside a Pod (the smallest unit), but because individual Pods are temporary, you use a Deployment.yml as a "manager" to ensure the correct number of copies are always running and healthy. Finally, since Pods frequently restart with new IP addresses, a Service acts as a stable "front door" or load balancer, providing a permanent address so users and other apps can always find your service.
